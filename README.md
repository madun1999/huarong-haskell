Huarong puzzle in Haskell
Chinese klotski puzzle
The Chinese wooden game Huarong Dao, based on the ancient history from the Three Kingdom period, is a special Klotski puzzle. Like other sliding-block puzzles, several different sized wooden blocks are placed inside a box. Each brick can only move vertically or horizontally according to the available space left. The goal of the game is to use the minimal steps to move Cao Cao (the largest square one) to a special area designated by the game board.

There are two players in our game. The player who solves the puzzle with fewer steps wins the game.
